# Typing Speed Test Game

Welcome to the **Typing Speed Test Game**, a fun way to improve and test your typing speed and accuracy! This game allows you to customize the text you type, adjust the duration of the test, and track both your speed and accuracy. There are two different modes: **Normal** and **Strict** mode. The game is perfect for users looking to challenge themselves or simply practice typing at their own pace.

## Features
- **Customizable text**: You can change the text that you will be typing during the test.
